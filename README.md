# PRISM: Pruning for Rank-adaptive Interpretable Segmentation Model

**PRISM** is a novel segmentation model that integrates **Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** within a deep neural architecture. Designed for historical document processing, PRISM automatically extracts meaningful and interpretable components from **multispectral images**, enhancing tasks such as **text binarization** and **image segmentation**. The framework has also demonstrated **generalization capabilities** to the **spectral unmixing** task, making it suitable for a broader range of remote sensing and imaging applications.

## A Prism for Vision

</p>

Just like a physical **prism** splits white light into a spectrum of colors, the **PRISM model** decomposes complex spectral data into distinct, interpretable visual components with :

- âœ… Fully interpretable component extraction  
- âœ… Rank-adaptive pruning during training  
- âœ… Built-in NMF module with spectral constraints  
- âœ… Outperforms traditional SoTA binarization methods on challenging heritage documents

2. **(b) SoTA binarization only (Howe)** â€” fails to extract faint or occluded text  
3. **(c) PRISM decomposition** â€” successfully separates text from background, enhancing readability and segmentation quality
