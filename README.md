# **PRISM**: Pruning for Rank-adaptive Interpretable Segmentation Model

**PRISM** is a novel segmentation model that integrates **Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** within a deep neural architecture. Designed for historical document processing, PRISM automatically extracts meaningful and interpretable components from **multispectral images**, enhancing tasks such as **text binarization** and **image segmentation**. The framework has also demonstrated **generalization capabilities** to the **spectral unmixing** task, making it suitable for a broader range of remote sensing and imaging applications.

## A Prism for Vision

</p>

Just like a physical **prism** splits white light into a spectrum of colors, the **PRISM model** decomposes complex spectral data into distinct, interpretable visual components with :

- âœ… Fully interpretable component extraction  
- âœ… Rank-adaptive pruning during training  
- âœ… Built-in NMF module with spectral constraints  
- âœ… Outperforms traditional SoTA binarization methods on challenging heritage documents

## Datasets
### MS-TEx (SMADI)

The **MS-TEx** dataset (Synchromedia Multispectral Ancient Document Images) is provided by the Synchromedia Laboratory.  
It consists of **multispectral images of historical documents** specifically designed for benchmarking text extraction and binarization algorithms under varying degradations.

### MSBin

The **MSBin** dataset focuses on **multispectral document binarization**, containing challenging degraded manuscripts captured under different spectral bands.  
It is a valuable benchmark for evaluating spectral decomposition and binarization performance.
